               <p>When Thomas Jefferson sited the library in the Rotunda, he did something revolutionary. He placed a library at the head of his academic institution, rather than the customary chapel. In doing so, and in the centuries since, the U.Va. Library has been central to the educational experience at U.Va. Your contribution will help us support research and scholarship, create and enhance spaces and programs for students and faculty, and preserve the results of intellectual discovery and creative endeavor for generations to come.</p>

               <h2>Research Support</h2>


               <p>The Library supports the U.Va. community in its academic research, from providing specialized collections and data services to experimenting with new technologies and partnerships to spur scholarship and share its results. Your gifts will enable not only the acquisition of collections, but also endowments to preserve them and ensure their survival. You will also be encouraging the creation of new knowledge at U.Va., and the transmission of that learning to students and scholars around the world.  </p>

               <h2>Student Experience</h2>


               <p>From the vibrant, collaborative spaces of Clemons to the elegant reading rooms of Alderman, the Library is central to the academic lives of U.Va. students. They meet with teachers, work on group projects, participate in programs and events, conduct research, and read quietly alone. Your contributions enable us to enhance those spaces and programs, and keep the Library an essential part of the U.Va. experience.</p>

               <h2>Preservation</h2>

<p>The U.Va. Library is the guardian of the University’s cultural and intellectual record, and the gateway to its use by faculty and students. Preservation is key to ensuring these valuable resources—from rare manuscripts to “born digital” works of scholarship—are accessible both now and far into the future. Your gift will help us tackle the challenges of caring for heavily-used books, treasured special collections, and digital materials that are crucial to scholarship but surprisingly fragile.</p>

               <p class="hide">
In 1824, Thomas Jefferson sent Frances Walker Gilmer to England to purchase books for the library of the University of Virginia. Since then, the Library has built up, burned down, regrown, and expanded into a system that now includes over a dozen facilities and a catalog of millions of books, articles, digital files, and more. Here are just a few highlights of the Library's nearly 200-year history.

Wertenbaker was an acquaintance of Edgar Allan Poe, and wrote of him in January of 1869: As Librarian I had frequent official intercourse with Mr. Poe, but it was at or near the close of the session before I met him in the social circle . . . He certainly was not habitually intemperate, but he may occasionally have entered into a frolic. I often saw him in the lecture room and in the library, but never in the slightest degree under the influence of intoxicating liquors. image: Portrait of William Wertenbaker—Special Collections, U.Va.

This significant collection of 12,500 items in American history, geography, and literature helped to establish the University as an important research center of American history. The McGregor Room was orginally built to house this collection.
